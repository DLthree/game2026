# Minimal Survivors Game

A tiny HTML5 survivors-like game that runs in mobile Safari with no build step.

## Features

- **Player**: Green circle that you control
- **Enemies**: Red squares that chase you
- **Projectiles**: Yellow triangles that auto-fire at enemies
- **Controls**: 
  - Desktop: WASD keys for movement
  - Mobile: Touch anywhere to move toward that position
- **Goal**: Survive as long as possible and get the highest score!

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
2. Move to avoid red squares
3. Yellow triangles auto-fire from your position toward enemies
4. Each enemy killed gives you 10 points
5. Each enemy collision takes 10 health
6. Game over when health reaches 0
7. Tap/click to restart after game over

## Technology

- Pure HTML5 Canvas 2D rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript (with TypeScript source)
- No build step required - just open index.html
- Works on mobile Safari with touch controls
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps gameplay

## Files

- `index.html` - Main game page
- `game.js` - Game logic (runs directly in browser)
- `game.ts` - TypeScript source (for type checking)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

## Development

The game runs directly from `game.js` with no build step. The `game.ts` file is provided for:
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Better IDE support
- Documentation

To type-check the TypeScript (optional):
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

No compilation is needed to run the game!
